The structure of the makfiles are tricky. There are several things
that you should pay attention to:

  - Execute ``make layout'' after you did any structure changes (remove or create projects).

  - All projects should put directly under ``prj/'' with build file ``Makefile'' and dependency file ``dep.mk''.
